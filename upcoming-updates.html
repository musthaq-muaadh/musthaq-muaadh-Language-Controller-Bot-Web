        <h2>Exciting New Feature: Unwanted Language Monitoring</h2>
        <p>
          We are thrilled to announce an upcoming update for the Language
          Controller Bot that will enhance its moderation capabilities by
          monitoring and addressing the use of unwanted language within your
          Discord server.
        </p>

        <h3>Whatâ€™s New?</h3>
        <p>
          The bot will soon be able to detect not only non-English languages but
          also offensive or inappropriate language in English. This feature will
          help keep your server safe and maintain a respectful environment by
          identifying and addressing the use of profane or harmful words.
        </p>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>
          Once activated, the bot will automatically scan messages for any
          flagged language based on a customizable list of offensive words. When
          unwanted language is detected, the bot will take the following
          actions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Issue a Warning:</strong> The bot will issue a private
            warning to the user who used the inappropriate language.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Notify Moderators:</strong> The bot will mention the role
            "Language_expert" to review the flagged message and take further
            action if necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Customizable Word List:</strong> Server administrators with
            the "Bot_controller" role can modify the list of offensive words to
            suit the needs of their server.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why This Update Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Maintaining a friendly, inclusive environment is crucial for a
          thriving community. With this new feature, the Language Controller Bot
          will provide your server with an additional layer of moderation,
          ensuring that all members communicate respectfully.
        </p>

        <h3>Availability</h3>
        <p>
          This update is expected to be released in the next few weeks. We will
          notify users through an announcement once it is live and available for
          installation.

        <h2>More Updates on the Way</h2>
        <p>
          We are continuously working to improve the Language Controller Bot to
          meet the needs of our users. Stay tuned for future updates that will
          bring more moderation options and features to enhance the management
          of your server.
