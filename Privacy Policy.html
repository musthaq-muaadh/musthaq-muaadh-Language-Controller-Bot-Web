        <p>
          <b
            >At Language Controller Bot, we respect your privacy and are
            committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy
            outlines the types of data we collect and how it is used.</b
          >
        </p>

        <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
          The Language Controller Bot does not collect or store any personal
          data directly. The bot only processes messages in real-time to detect
          languages that are not English, and it does not store any message
          content after the processing is complete. All operations are performed
          in memory, and no data is saved.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Role and Message Information</h2>
        <p>
          In order to function, the bot uses role information (such as the
          "Bot_controller" and "Language_expert" roles) within the Discord
          server to identify who can execute commands and who will be notified
          about flagged messages. These roles are fetched in real-time and are
          not stored by the bot.
        </p>

        <h2>3. No Personal Identifiable Information</h2>
        <p>
          The Language Controller Bot does not request or store any personal
          identifiable information (PII). It does not collect data about users,
          their Discord IDs, or any other personal data. The bot functions
          solely within the context of the server, with no external data being
          collected or stored.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          Although the bot does not store any data, we take security measures to
          ensure that the bot operates safely within your server. Our bot is
          designed to respect the security and privacy of your server and its
          members. We advise you to ensure your Discord server permissions are
          correctly configured to maintain your own privacy and security.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will
          be reflected on this page, and we will make efforts to inform users of
          significant updates. Continued use of the bot constitutes acceptance
          of any changes made to the Privacy Policy.
        </p>
