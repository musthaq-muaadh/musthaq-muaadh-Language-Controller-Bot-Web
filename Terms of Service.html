        <p>
          <b
            >Welcome to the Language Controller Bot. These Terms of Service
            ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the bot in any Discord
            server. By inviting and using this bot, you agree to these Terms in
            full. If you do not agree, you must refrain from using the bot.</b
          >
        </p>

        <h2>1. General Usage</h2>
        <p>
          The Language Controller Bot is a moderation tool designed to monitor
          and warn users who post messages in languages other than English. It
          automates the moderation process by issuing warnings when non-English
          messages are detected. The bot is intended to help maintain server
          rules and streamline the moderation process. The bot may mention a
          user with the "Language_expert" role to review flagged messages for
          accuracy and context. Using the bot must align with all relevant
          Discord guidelines and policies.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Bot Commands</h2>
        <p>
          The bot provides specific commands for managing its functionality
          within your Discord server. Only users with the "Bot_controller" role
          can execute the following commands:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>/activate</strong>: Activates the bot for monitoring
            language usage in the server.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>/deactivate</strong>: Temporarily disables the bot and stops
            all monitoring activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>/allow_to_this_channel</strong>: Allows the bot to monitor
            language in a specific channel.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>/disallow_to_this_channel</strong>: Prevents the bot from
            monitoring language in a specified channel.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These commands allow server administrators to control where and when
          the bot is active, providing flexibility to fit your server’s needs.
          Misuse of the commands may result in the bot being removed from the
          server.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Role-based Permissions</h2>
        <p>
          For security and control purposes, the bot restricts the use of
          commands to users with the "Bot_controller" role. The bot will flag
          messages that are not in English and notify the "Language_expert" role
          to review and address the situation. This feature ensures that flagged
          messages are handled appropriately by trusted members of the server.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Limitations of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          The developers of the Language Controller Bot do not guarantee that
          the bot will be free from errors or uninterrupted. The bot is provided
          "as is," and we disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied.
          The bot may fail to detect certain languages or produce false
          positives, and we cannot be held responsible for any damages or issues
          that arise from the use of the bot, including server disruptions or
          miscommunication caused by flagged messages.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Future Updates and Modifications</h2>
        <p>
          The bot may receive future updates to improve its functionality, fix
          bugs, or introduce new features. These updates may be applied
          automatically without prior notification. We reserve the right to
          modify or discontinue the bot at any time without liability to users.
          Users are encouraged to review the bot’s terms periodically to stay
          informed about any changes that may affect usage.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in our
          services or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. If there
          are material changes to these Terms, we will notify you by updating
          this document. Your continued use of the bot after such updates
          constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.
